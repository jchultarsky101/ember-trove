## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Quick-capture FAB: floating amber button (bottom-right) opens a modal for rapid node creation with title, type, and optional notes fields; Ctrl+Enter to save, Esc to cancel; navigates to new NodeDetail on success.

### Changed
- **Ember warm theme**: replaced all cool-gray tones with Tailwind `stone` palette and blue accents with `amber`/`orange`, delivering a warm "winter fire" aesthetic consistent across both light and dark modes.
  - Light mode: `stone-50` parchment background, `stone-900` text, `amber-600` primary actions.
  - Dark mode: `stone-950` near-black background, `stone-100` text, `amber-400` links and accents.
  - Graph edges: References use `amber-600`, WikiLinks use `orange-400`.
  - Keycloak login theme updated to match warm ember palette.
